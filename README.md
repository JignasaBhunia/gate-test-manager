Gate Test Manager - Final Package
===================================
This package contains the single-file web app and seeded tests.
Files:
- index.html : run this in a browser. It embeds seed data into localStorage.
- tests_seed.csv : CSV with all seeded tests and subjects (subjects assigned heuristically from PDFs)
- raw_data/ : the uploaded schedules (PDFs)
- exports/ : empty folder for your exports

Next steps:
1. Unzip and inspect files locally.
2. Replace index.html with the full UI version if desired (the canvas version includes the full interface & charts).
3. Upload repo contents to GitHub and connect to Vercel for deployment.
